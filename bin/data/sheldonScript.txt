BEGIN（はじめ）:
BEGIN（はじめ）:
When I look in your eyes,
and you're looking back in mine.
Everything feels,
not quite normal.
Because I feel,
stronger and weaker at the same time.
I feel,
excited,
and at the same time,
terrified.
The truth is,
I don't know what I feel,
except,
I know what kind of man I want to be.
THE END（終わり）
